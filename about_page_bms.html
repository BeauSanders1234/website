    <h1>Beau-Michael Sanders</h1>
    <h3>Photographic installation artist </h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Beau-Michael sanders grew up in a small town in Louisiana, several mile outside of Baton Rouge. During high school he was always interested in art, always wanting to learn more. When he was sixteen he recevied his first camera. this gift really sparked his interest in photography, igniting a new found passion. After graduating high school he decided to attend school at Memphis College of Art where he has been for the past five years. beau sets out to help raise awareness about ecological issues. he does not just use photography as a means of conveying his ideas, but uses installations to furter push the meaning of his work. When creating an installation, beau goes out collecting either natural elements or elements of waste, sometimes both. once he has collected these components he then begins to construct the installation adding his images as he goes. Most images used in his work, are images of litter or other pollutants he has found causeing harm within the environment. beau like many others find peace in these environments, and can not help but notice human actions are having an effect on these environments. if we do not stand up and bring light to this issue, he fears we will pass a point where nothing can be done to repair the damages caused. </p>
